# Platformer Game

Status: Finished <br />
This is the final state of the project, I will not be adding to it or providing any bug fixes.

## About

This is a 2d platformer created for my A level, CS project, along side this I made a level editor to create levels for this game (https://github.com/Gocra/CS-Level-Editor). The character must kill or avoid enemies and pitfalls. The player must traverse the map and reach the end of the level.

### My Experience Making This Project

This is the first big programming project I have ever made, it was also my first time using pygame so I had to learn as I went along. This lead to some code being unorganised or not as well written as it could have been. The assets I have used were found online by different creators, so do not go together perfectly.

I did make the Github logo and code button asset. I found a social media buttons asset on itch (linked in the credit section). Using GIMP, I took their youtube icon button as the base, and drew the github logo, and code icon on instead. The green versions were done by selecting the logo and then changing the Hue, Chroma, Lightness to make it green.
